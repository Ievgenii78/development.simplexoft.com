<ul>

<h3>Legal basis for collecting your personal data</h3>

<p>We are a credit broker and in order to provide our service we share your information with our panel of lenders and credit brokers to assist you in finding a suitable financial services product. </p>

<p>When you complete all loan application details on our website we process this data on the basis that we have a legitimate interest in processing this data. </p>

<p>The legitimate interests basis is defined by Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR as being where â€˜processing is necessary for our legitimate interests or the legitimate interests of a third party, unless there is a good reason to protect your personal data which overrides those legitimate interestsâ€™. </p>

<h3>How we use your Personal Data</h3>

<p>We use the personal data you input via the online loan application form to match your details with our panel of lenders and credit brokers. </p>

<p>We, and our panel of lenders and credit brokers, will keep you informed as to the progress of your loan application via telephone, email or SMS unless specified otherwise. </p>

<p>In addition, we may also send you information regarding similar products or services using the contact information that you supplied to us as part of your application.  This forms an essential part of our service which you can opt out of at any time by clicking the link <a href="https://optme.co" target="_blank">https://optme.co</a>
 or by emailing us at <a href="mailto:compliance@mindflowmarketing.co.uk">compliance@mindflowmarketing.co.uk</a>
</p>

<p>The basis on which we are able to send you this information is called â€˜soft opt-inâ€™.  As an existing customer who has provided us with your details in order to use our credit broking services, we are able to contact you about similar products or services.  </p>

<p>If we cannot find a suitable lender on our panel then we may pass your personal data onto another credit broker who may have a lender that meets your eligibility criteria on their panel. </p>
<p>Please be aware that our lenders with whom we share your information may use it for their legitimate business interests to match applications, carry out fraud checks, carry out research such as analysis of market trends and customer demographics and to customise and develop the product/service which they may offer to you or other individuals in the future. Most lenders might use this for up to twelve months. </p>

<p>4. Regulatory bodies</p>

CRAs provide us with shared credit data, fraud prevention data and public data; this data will include the electoral register. You may contact any or all the credit reference agencies (CRA's) directly. <li> 
</ul>
<p>Fraud Prevention Agencies (FPAs) </p>
<ul>
<li>When we assess your application we will also check your identity in order to prevent fraud and crime; this includes money laundering. We may also make additional searches over periods of time with CRAs and FPAs. This ensures that our records are kept up to date with any vital data. This data will then be used to ascertain whether to continue with your credit or any future credit that may be available. As we have an obligation to comply with responsible lending, FPAs and CRAs assist us in doing so.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you choose to contact a CRA, please bear in mind that the data held may not be the same so it may be useful to contact all CRAs. You are legally entitled to a free copy of your statutory credit report every 12 months directly from any of the 3 main credit agencies. </p>

<p>The three main Credit Reference Agencies, TransUnion, Equifax and Experian will use and share your data in line with the Credit Reference Agency Information Notice (CRAIN) for further information on how CRAs use your data please visit their websites as stated below: </p>

<p>Data sent to CRAs
<ul>
<li>Data received by CRAs will be recorded by them. If after an application via us you take out a loan, the activity and details of management of your account will be passed onto them by the lender. In the event that you take out a loan and fail to repay back the full funds required this will also be recorded with the CRA. In this case data may be passed onto other companies by CRAs and FPAs in order to locate and trace you in order to recover any outstanding debts. We must warn you that if this does occur then this will remain on your record for 6 years once a case has been closed by either settlement or default.</li> </p>
</ul>
<p>Inaccurate information provided by you</p>
<ul>

<li>False or inaccurate data if given by yourself will be brought to the attention of FPAs or other relevant companies who deal in fraud/crime prevention. The same applies if we or our lenders suspect fraud or false or inaccurate data has been supplied. Any reported instances may also be accessed by law enforcement agencies i.e. HMRC, regulatory bodies or the police, for use to prevent any possible fraud and money laundering for the following: </li>
<li>Managing credit and credit related accounts or facilities</li>
<li>Recovering debt</li>
<li>Checking details on proposals and claims for all types of insurance</li>
<li>Checking details of job applicants and employees</li>
<li>Data recorded outside the UK</li>
</ul>

<p>We or our lenders may use and get access to data outside of the UK that has been recorded and reported by fraud prevention agencies. </p>

<h3>How long do we keep your data for? </h3>

<p>The amount of time we retain your data for depends on the basis it was provided by you to us: </p>
<ul>

<li>In order to provide you with a service we will be required to keep the data whilst we continue to provide you with a service for however long this may take us. </li>
<li>If you request that we do not contact you for advertising and marketing reasons, then we still need to keep your application data as this reflects your preferences. The information we retain will be the minimum we are required to keep</li>
<li>Data is kept relating to any transactions you may enter via our website. This data will be kept for a minimum of 6 years which will commence at the end of the relationship. We are required to do this to ensure that if any disputes or complaints are raised, then we have your data to enable us to address the complaints or disputes. </li>
<li>In order to comply with our obligations under UK &EU law. </li>
<li>We will retain your personal data as advised above unless we have a legitimate reason for retaining it beyond those dates. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Where will your personal data be held? </h3>

<p>Your personal data may be held within the European Economic Area which comes under the GDPR. Where personal data is transferred or stored outside of the European Economic Union we check whether the EU Commission has issued an adequacy decision, which is a confirmation from them that the personal data will be afforded the same level of protection as if it was within the European Economic Union. </p>

<p>If there is not an adequacy decision in place, and to comply with GDPR requirements, we will ensure the transfer of personal data is protected by other means, including where explicit consent from the data subject has been received or through contractual obligations with relevant third parties regarding usage of the personal data. </p>

<h3>Confidentiality & security</h3>

<p>Keeping your personal data secure and confidential is of tantamount importance to us. Due to this we have introduced rules, measures, specialist technology and implemented security policies to ensure that your data is protected. </p>

<p>We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption to secure your personal data and only provide your personal data to the staff who have to access it for the function of carrying out their duties. </p>

<p>Whilst we make every attempt to protect your data there are still risks involved when inputting your data online and we need to make you aware of this. </p>

<p>We can further confirm that all parties we share your personal data with, such as our lenders, credit brokers and trusted third parties are bound by contract to maintain the security and integrity of your personal data. </p>

<p>Please be advised that, although Mindflow Marketing Ltd takes all reasonable precautions to protect your data, no data storage or data transmission security is guaranteed. Accordingly, Mindflow Marketing Ltd cannot, and does not, represent, warrant, or guarantee the complete security of any data storage or data transmission.

<p>You have the right to know who has access to your personal data, what it is being used for, where it's kept, and everything about your personal data as it passes through our data process. </p>

<p>A 'Subject Access Request' (SAR) can be made requesting us to supply you with all reasonable information or documentation that we hold relating to your personal data. You can make a subject access request verbally or in writing. If you make your request verbally, we recommend you follow it up in writing to provide a clear trail of correspondence. </p>
<p>Before providing any information we must verify the identity of the person making the request using 'reasonable means'. We will ask you for your first name, surname, date of birth, address, a utility bill (or similar) and the method by which you received marketing communications. </p>

<p>Please email your SAR to our Data Protection Officer at <a href="mailto:compliance@mindflowmarketing.co.uk">compliance@mindflowmarketing.co.uk</a>
</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can post your request to Manchester Business Park, 3000 Aviator Way, Manchester, M22 5TG. </p>

<p>Responses will be provided electronically in a clear format unless requested otherwise. We have one month to comply with this request but if the request is complex can extend the period for a further two months. You would be notified of the time limit when making the request. </p>

<p>For more information on how you make a SAR please visit <a href="https://ico.org.uk/your-data-matters/your-right-to-get-copies-of-your-data/" target="_blank">https://ico.org.uk/your-data-matters/your-right-to-get-copies-of-your-data/</a></p>

<h3>Right to rectification</h3>

<p>The GDPR includes a right for individuals to have inaccurate personal data rectified or completed if it is incomplete. </p>

<p>It is important that the personal data you input on this website is accurate, complete and up to date. </p>

<p>We will assume the personal data you provide is correct and provide our services on this basis. If fraudulent information is given then we may be alerted to this by a Fraud Prevention Agency. </p>

<p>If you think you have mistakenly given us incorrect information, please contact us at <a href="mailto:compliance@mindflowmarketing.co.uk">compliance@mindflowmarketing.co.uk</a>
 and we will update it as soon as possible. </p>

<p>Whilst we make every effort to ensure the personal data we hold about you is right, if you notice any errors in any communications received from us please send us an email detailing the changes to the email address above and we will ensure it is accurate. </p>

<p>We will rectify the information within a month of receiving your request and inform all relevant third parties of the amendment. If the request is complex we can extend the period for a further two months. </p>

<h3>Right to erasure</h3>

<p>You have the right to erasure which is also known as a 'request to be forgotten'. This equates to asking for any personal data you have supplied to be removed from our systems where there is no reason to keep processing it. </p>

<p>This right can be exercised under the following circumstances: </p>
<ul>
<li>Where the individual withdraws consent</li>
<li>Where the personal data is no longer necessary in relation to the purpose for which it was originally collected/processed. </li>
<li>The personal data was unlawfully processed (i.e. otherwise in breach of the GDPR). </li>
<li>When the individual objects to the processing and there is no overriding legitimate interest for continuing processing. </li>
<li>The personal data has to be erased in order to comply with a legal obligation. </li>
<li>The personal data is processed in relation to the offer of information society services to a child. </li>
</ul>
<p>We will suppress and remove all data held, upon request. Our marketing partners will immediately be informed of the request and will follow the same actions. We will however keep the communication of the 'request to be forgotten' for our records. Where we cannot remove all your personal data we will notify you. </p>

<p>Grounds on which we can legally refuse a request are: </p>
<ul>
<li>To comply with a legal obligation</li>
<li>The exercise or defence of legal claims</li>
<li>To exercise the right of freedom of expression and information</li>
</ul>
<h3>Right to restrict processing</h3>

<p>You can ask us to stop or restrict processing your personal data. It is an alternative to requesting erasure of your data. </p>

<p>This is not an absolute right and will only apply in certain circumstances such as: </p>
<ul>
<li>Where you are contesting the accuracy of your personal data and we are verifying the accuracy of the data. </li>
<li>The data has been unlawfully processed (i.e. in breach of the lawfulness requirement) </li>
<li>We no longer need the personal data but we need to keep it in order to establish, exercise or defend a legal claim. </li>
</ul>
<p>As a matter of good practice we will automatically restrict processing your personal data whilst we are considering its accuracy or the legitimate grounds for processing the personal data in question. </p>

<p>When we restrict your personal data, we are still permitted to store it but not use it. We will inform all relevant third parties to confirm this right is carried out. </p>

<p>You can make a request for restriction at any time and we have one month in which to respond to your request. This can be extended by two months where the request is complex or we receive a number of requests. We would advise you if an extension is necessary clearly stating our reasons why. </p>

<h3>Right to data portability</h3>

<p>The right to data portability allows individuals to obtain and reuse their personal data for their own purposes across different services. Before transferring your personal data we will carry out rigorous checks to verify your identity. </p>

<p>The right to data portability applies: </p>
<ul>
<li>To personal data an individual has provided to a controller; </li>
<li>Where the processing is based on the individual's consent or for the performance of a contract; and</li>
<li>When processing is carried out by automated means. </li>
If you request us to transfer your information we will do so in a format that is structured, commonly used and in a machine-readable form. </li>
We will respond to your request within one month. This can be extended by two months where the request is complex or we receive a number of requests. We would advise you if an extension is necessary clearly stating our reasons why. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Right to object</h3>

<p>You have the right to object to processing based on legitimate interests or the performance of a task in the public interest/exercise of official authority (including profiling); direct marketing (including profiling); and processing for purposes of scientific/historical research and statistics. </p>

<h3>Rights in relation to automated decision making and profiling</h3>
<p>You have the right to object to automated decision making, to express your point of view, ask for human intervention, and to be provided with an explanation of the decision with your option to challenge it. The right is not absolute and is not applicable for the entering into a consumer credit agreement. </p>
