The term payday loan shows the origins of this type of credit, which was when employees would sub money from their wages in advance. However, this was often insufficient and left their pay packet too lite the following month, so payday loans with slightly longer repayment periods make borrowing a small amount more manageable for most people.
      How long you repay the loan over will depend on the repayment period you select when applying. People usually try to pay the loan off as soon as they can, without causing them more financial difficulty. This means shorter loans are often taken over a shorter period, while larger loans are more likely to be taken with a longer repayment period.

Our panel only includes regulated reputable lenders.
      The APR rates for Payday Loans are high, but this is often a reflection of the short-term nature of the loan. The FCA regulation also means all lenders must include their rates on advertising, which has led to increased competition between them, which can only be good news for the average borrower.

This type of loan is designed to act as a short-term solution to unexpected financial difficulties, such as an unforeseen repair bill or family emergency. This generally means the people applying are in a stressful situation and need the money in order to resolve their problem. This means direct lenders have designed the process to be as quick as possible. This is partly to help the applicants, and partly because providing faster access to the borrowed money can be enough to win you a new customer. We quote a time of 10 minutes* as an average. It’s often quicker than this, but we have no control over your bank’s internal systems, so quote this time to be on the safe side.

                    <p>
                      A payday loan or short term loan can be particularly
                      useful when faced with an unexpected expense that can’t
                      wait.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Some people can be put off using payday loans because of
                      the high APR rates quoted. However, this is because the
                      loans are generally over a short period, providing a
                      direct lender with a narrow window for interest to be
                      accumulated. Since the FCA introduced a cap on interest
                      rates and the number of times a loan can be rolled over,
                      all lenders now adhere to these fair lending rules.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      If you’re unsure of any aspect of your loan, please read
                      the relevant information in your agreement, as lenders are
                      required to be transparent about any interest or charges
                      they are going to apply. Remember, you are under no
                      obligation to accept any offer that a lender makes to you
                      and you should never pay any fees for a loan.

                      If you want to clear your loan in full on your next
                      payday, you can. However, the term for a payday loan is
                      usually 3-months or more. The term payday loan shows the
                      origins of this type of credit, which was when employees
                      would sub money from their wages in advance. However, this
                      was often insufficient and left their pay packet too lite
                      the following month, so payday loans with slightly longer
                      repayment periods make borrowing a small amount more
                      manageable for most people.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      How long you repay the loan over will depend on the
                      repayment period you select when applying. People usually
                      try to pay the loan off as soon as they can, without
                      causing them more financial difficulty. This means shorter
                      loans are often taken over a shorter period, while larger
                      loans are more likely to be taken with a longer repayment
                      period.

                      increased competition between them, which can only be good

                      There is no such thing as the best payday lender, just the
                      one that is best for you at any given time. In most cases,
                      this will be the lender that’s offering the best interest
                      rate and most preferable terms. The terms each lender
                      offers, and their rates vary quite often. Some run special
                      offers for payday loans or change their position
                      permanently to remain competitive or attract new business.
                      When you use Payday UK, you’ll know you’re being offered
                      the best rate from our industry-leading panel of lenders,
                      and that they are all registered and regulated by the FCA
                      (Financial Conduct Authority). We’ll always try to match
                      you with the best lender in our panel for your situation.

                      All direct lenders are required by the FCA (Financial
                      Conduct Authority) to perform a full credit check before
                      releasing any funds. However, applying with Payday UK
                      won’t affect your credit score, as we only initially
                      perform a soft search, which leaves no permanent mark. If
                      you accept a loan offer, they will perform the full
                      search, but you will already know you meet their criteria
                      before it’s done.

                      If you apply for credit and are refused, it can be bad for
                      your credit rating. However, a payday loan that is paid
                      back according to the agreed terms will only improve your
                      credit score. Because our application process only uses a
                      soft search, there is no negative effect on your credit
                      score. If you decide to accept a loan offer, you’ll
                      already know you meet the lender’s criteria. If you fail
                      to repay the loan according to the agreed terms, it can
                      negatively affect your credit rating.

                      <a href="quick-loans/index.htm">money quickly</a>. This
                      type of loan is designed to act as a short-term solution
                      to unexpected financial difficulties, such as an
                      unforeseen repair bill or family emergency. This generally
                      means the people applying are in a stressful situation and
                      need the money in order to resolve their problem. This
                      means

                      >. This is partly to help the applicants, and partly
                      because providing faster access to the borrowed money can
                      be enough to win you a new customer. We quote a time of 10
                      minutes* as an average. It’s often quicker than this, but
                      we have no control over your bank’s internal systems, so
                      quote this time to be on the safe side.

                  †Payday UK will not perform a credit check, lenders will
                  complete a soft search when assessing your eligibility for a
                  loan. If you accept a lender&#8217;s loan offer, they will
                  perform a hard credit search.<br />
                  *Subject to lenders requirements and approval. Once approved,
                  your cash could be sent within 10 minutes. The time that it
                  takes for the cash to be received in your account will depend
                  on your bank’s policies and procedures. **Based on the average
