All this competition is good news for consumers, as it means more lenders are offering better rates and special offers to win the consumers custom. However, the payday loan market is very fluid, and what might be the best solution for you might not be right for someone else. The best deal one week might not be the same the following week.

Here is some information that may help you decide.</p></div></div></div><div class="full-width-container-padding-no" style=" "><div class="container"><div class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6 mobile-stack-30"><p>We have all faced unexpected expenses at inconvenient times. It can be a household emergency, such as a boiler breaking down, or an important car repair you can&#8217;t afford to postpone. Often, when something arises, we haven&#8217;t budgeted for it can leave us short of money. Some of us will turn to friends or family, but they aren&#8217;t always able to help, even if they&#8217;d like to.</p><p>When people find themselves in this situation, they&#8217;ll often turn to Google and search for things like short-term loans, emergency money, payday loans etc.</p></div><div class="col-md-6 mobile-stack-30"><p>Depending on the exact search term you use, you are likely to be shown Lending Stream, Sunny, Satsuma, Uncle Buck and Peachy amongst the results. These are all known as direct lenders, as they borrow the money to you directly.</p><p>Other companies you may come across, are brokers of payday and short-term loans. A broker&#8217;s website may look identical to a direct lender, providing lots of useful information and allowing you to apply for a loan and receive an instant decision.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="container page-content faq-section"><h2 class="aligncenter">More questions?

All brokers must state on their website that they are a broker. Some brokers may charge a fee for finding a suitable lender.</p><p>A lender will lend you the money directly, presuming you&#8217;re eligible. It&#8217;s crucial that if you use a direct lender, you understand their terms and conditions attached to the loan.</p></div></div><div class="question panel panel-default"><div class="panel-heading"><h3 class="panel-title"><a data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#questions-collapse" href="#questions-collapse-2">What are the pros and cons?</a></h3></div><div class="answer-content panel-collapse collapse" id="questions-collapse-2"><p>A broker will usually have access to several different direct lenders. When you apply using a broker, you are compared to the criteria for all their lenders, and a good broker will then show you the best result available for your circumstances.</p><p>A direct lender only has their products to offer, so while you can still apply, they won&#8217;t compare different lenders to ensure you get the best rate. Instead, if eligible, you&#8217;ll be offered a loan at their current rate, regardless of how competitive this rate is.</p></div></div><div class="question panel panel-default"><div class="panel-heading"><h3 class="panel-title"><a data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#questions-collapse" href="#questions-collapse-3">Can there be a big difference between APR rates?</a></h3></div><div class="answer-content panel-collapse collapse" id="questions-collapse-3"><p>Yes. Over the last couple of decades, short-term and payday loans have grown massively in popularity. More people than ever are choosing a short-term loan to help them out of a sticky situation. This has made the market far more competitive, with lenders all vying for your business. Even lenders that specialise in loans for people with poor credit compete with other lenders.</p><p>All this competition is good news for consumers, as it means more lenders are offering better rates and special offers to win the consumers custom. However, the payday loan market is very fluid, and what might be the best solution for you might not be right for someone else. The best deal one week might not be the same the following week. This flexibility passes the advantage to brokers, who&#8217;ll compare dozens of companies to ensure you&#8217;re getting the best current deal available for you.</p></div></div><div class="question panel panel-default"><div class="panel-heading"><h3 class="panel-title"><a data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#questions-collapse" href="#questions-collapse-4">Is a payday loan right for you?</a></h3></div><div class="answer-content panel-collapse collapse" id="questions-collapse-4"><p>Many people use payday loans to successfully keep their heads above water at various times throughout the year.
