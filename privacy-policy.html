Legal basis for processing: our legitimate interests (Article 6(1)(f) of the General Data Protection Regulation).<br />
Legitimate interest: where the legal obligations are part of the laws of another country and have not been integrated into the United Kingdom&rsquo;s legal framework, we have a legitimate interest in complying with these obligations.</p>

<p><strong>How long we retain your information</strong></p>

<p>This section sets out how long we retain your information. We have set out specific retention periods where possible. Where that has not been possible, we have set out the criteria we use to determine the retention period.</p>

<p><strong>Retention periods</strong></p>

<p>Server log information: we retain information on our server logs for 12 months.<br />
Correspondence and enquiries: when you make an enquiry or correspond with us for any reason, whether by email, or via our contact form or by phone, we will retain your information for as long as it takes to respond to and resolve your enquiry, and for 12 further month(s), after which point we will delete your information.<br />
Criteria for determining retention periods<br />
In any other circumstances, we will retain your information for no longer than necessary, taking into account the following:<br />
&bull; the purpose(s) and use of your information both now and in the future (such as whether it is necessary to continue to store that information in order to continue to perform our obligations under a contract with you or to contact you in the future);<br />
&bull; whether we have any legal obligation to continue to process your information (such as any record-keeping obligations imposed by relevant law or regulation);<br />
&bull; whether we have any legal basis to continue to process your information (such as your consent);<br />
&bull; how valuable your information is (both now and in the future);<br />
&bull; any relevant agreed industry practices on how long information should be retained;<br />
&bull; the levels of risk, cost and liability involved with us continuing to hold the information;<br />
&bull; how hard it is to ensure that the information can be kept up to date and accurate; and<br />
&bull; any relevant surrounding circumstances (such as the nature and status of our relationship with you).</p>

<p><strong>How we secure your information</strong></p>

<p>We take appropriate technical and organisational measures to secure your information and to protect it against unauthorised or unlawful use and accidental loss or destruction, including:<br />
&bull; only sharing and providing access to your information to the minimum extent necessary, subject to confidentiality restrictions where appropriate, and on an anonymised basis wherever possible;<br />
&bull; using secure servers to store your information<br />
&bull; verifying the identity of any individual who requests access to information prior to granting them access to information;<br />
&bull; using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software to encrypt any information you submit to us via any forms on our website<br />
Transmission of information to us by email<br />
Transmission of information over the internet is not entirely secure, and if you submit any information to us over the internet (whether by email, via our website or any other means), you do so entirely at your own risk.<br />
We cannot be responsible for any costs, expenses, loss of profits, harm to reputation, damages, liabilities or any other form of loss or damage suffered by you as a result of your decision to transmit information to us by such means.</p>

<p><strong>Transfers of your information outside the European Economic Area</strong></p>

<p>Your information will be transferred and stored outside the European Economic Area (EEA) in the circumstances set out below. We will also transfer your information outside the EEA or to an international organisation in order to comply with legal obligations to which we are subject (compliance with a court order, for example). Where we are required to do so, we will ensure appropriate safeguards and protections are in place.</p>

You have the following rights in relation to your information, which you may exercise by writing to us or sending an email to legal@dl.uk.<br />
&bull; to object to us using or processing your information where we use or process it in order to carry out a task in the public interest or for our legitimate interests, including &lsquo;profiling&rsquo; (i.e. analysing or predicting your behaviour based on your information) based on any of these purposes; and<br />
&bull; to object to us using or processing your information for direct marketing purposes (including any profiling we engage in that is related to such direct marketing).<br />
