                                <li>For internal operational purposes: statistical analysis; to develop and improve our products; to update our records; to identify which of our, or others', products might interest you; to assess lending risks; to identify, prevent, detect or tackle fraud, money laundering and other crime; to carry out regulatory checks; keep you informed about your lending or borrowing and for market research</li>

                                <li>to a credit reference agency to check your identity and to prevent fraud (they will also keep a record of your request and use it whenever anyone applies to be authenticated in your name);</li>
                                <li>if you are a Borrower, to tell credit reference agencies that you have an account and how you run that account;</li>
                                <li>to our agents and subcontractors, acting for us or for Lenders, to use for the purpose of operating the Platform and obtaining payment;</li>
                                <li>to investigate, prevent or detect fraud or carry out checks against money laundering;</li>
                                <li>to share Data via an organisation which provides a centralised application matching service which it collects from and about mortgage and/or credit applications, for the purpose of preventing and detecting fraud;</li>
                                <li>to a reputable, licensed credit broker or lender in the event that you apply to borrow money on the Platform, your application is declined or the loan monies are otherwise unavailable and we reasonably believe that the credit broker or lender may be able to help you obtain a loan. In these cases, the third party may use your personal data provided via the Platform application to perform a soft search with a credit reference agency to check your eligibility for their products. A soft search will not impact your credit rating;</li>
                                <li>to trace debtors and recover debt;</li>

                                    Equifax, Experian and Callcredit, the ICO and major financial services trade associations, we have developed a common statement, Credit Reference Agency Information Notice (CRAIN), defining the standards that all three Credit Reference Agencies will apply across all products and services in relation to processing consumer data.

                                    If your loan is subsequently not funded by The Money Platform, in order to facilitate your search for a loan, we may pass your details to Digitonomy trading as Little Loans, a credit broker authorised by the FCA (authorisation number 690249), to help you find a loan. If you choose to use the services or brands of Digitonomy to further your loan search, Digitonomy will conduct a soft credit search which will not show on your credit file. Your details may be passed to other lenders - these lenders may carry out additional soft credit searches in order to assess whether they are able to offer you a loan and you may be contacted by SMS, email, telephone or automated message by any lender that has approved your application for the purpose of progressing your application with them. Note that in passing your details to credit brokers, The Money Platform is itself acting as a credit broker (i.e. an introducer) and will receive a commission directly from the credit broker following a successful introduction.
