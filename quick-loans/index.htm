If you&#8217;re eligible for your chosen quick loan, then you will be shown the best deal currently available for you. If you accept the loan offer, the money will usually be in your bank account in a matter of minutes. 
Sometimes an applicant with bad credit or unusual circumstances might be required to have a guarantor to secure the loan. This can take a little longer but is still relatively quick. The only other aspect beyond our control is your bank&#8217;s internal systems. These are the main reason we quote a time of ten minutes* to receive your loan because while we will transfer the money virtually immediately, there can be a short delay while your bank processes the payment.

While payday loans initially received a lot of bad press, the introduction of FCA (Financial Conduct Authority) regulations and guidelines has eliminated the cowboy companies that were charging outlandish interest rates with unrealistic repayment terms. Every direct lender on our panel is a licensed and reputable lender that abides by the FCA&#8217;s regulatory and ethical guidelines. This provides consumers with an increased level of protection against unscrupulous companies. 
Payday loan rates can still look high in comparison to traditional loans. This is often because of the short-term nature of the loans, giving the lender a short amount of time to make a profit. However, any sort of borrowing can start to become a lot more expensive if you fail to meet the agreed repayments. This is why it&#8217;s essential to be realistic when selecting your repayment terms. It&#8217;s also important to communicate with your lender if you&#8217;re experiencing any difficulty in making the payments.

We don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s fair to punish you for years by denying you access to the loan market when you might be in need of a little extra money. Depending on your situation, some lenders will charge a higher rate of interest to borrowers with a low credit score, which they see as a direct reflection of the increased risk they are taking. With our service, even those with bad credit know they are getting the best rates available to them at that time. 
If you apply for a quick loan, accept the loan offer, then make all the scheduled payments as agreed, a payday loan should only help to improve your credit rating.

Just because a quick loan is easy to apply for, it doesn&#8217;t mean you should consider a fix for every financial situation. Payday loans are designed to offer short-term relief from an unexpected expense. They should not be used as a solution to longer-term financial difficulty.

The funds would then be deducted from their next pay packet. The main similarity between subs from an employer and a payday loan is they are both usually for small amounts, and they are typically required to tide us over temporarily. 
The wide range of amounts and repayment terms have developed a category of loan in its own right. This allows people who need to borrow a larger amount to keep the payments to a reasonable level, rather than having a massive deduction from their wages and just deferring the financial pain until your next payday. People borrowing a smaller amount will still usually opt for a shorter repayment period. This helps to minimise the interest they are charged.

Modern websites are designed in a way that provides just as good an experience for mobile users as someone using a tablet or computer. Some people may have security concerns about using a mobile device to apply for a quick loan. However, if your phone has the latest version of the manufacturer&#8217;s software and is connected via the cellular network or secure Wi-Fi connection (like you&#8217;ll have in your home), then the built-in security is more than enough.</p></div></div><div class="question panel panel-default"><div class="panel-heading"><h3 class="panel-title"><a data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#questions-collapse" href="#questions-collapse-3">How quickly will I receive my money?</a></h3></div><div class="answer-content panel-collapse collapse" id="questions-collapse-3"><p>We will endeavour to get the cash into your bank as quickly as possible.

While payday loans initially received a lot of bad press, the introduction of <a href="../index-2.htm" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FCA (Financial Conduct Authority)</a> regulations and guidelines has eliminated the cowboy companies that were charging outlandish interest rates with unrealistic repayment terms. Every direct lender on our panel is a licensed and reputable lender that abides by the FCA&#8217;s regulatory and ethical guidelines. This provides consumers with an increased level of protection against unscrupulous companies.</p><p>Payday loan rates can still look high in comparison to traditional loans. This is often because of the short-term nature of the loans, giving the lender a short amount of time to make a profit. However, any sort of borrowing can start to become a lot more expensive if you fail to meet the agreed repayments. This is why it&#8217;s essential to be realistic when selecting your repayment terms. It&#8217;s also important to communicate with your lender if you&#8217;re experiencing any difficulty in making the payments.</p></div></div><div class="question panel panel-default"><div class="panel-heading"><h3 class="panel-title"><a data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#questions-collapse" href="#questions-collapse-5">Can I get a quick loan if I have bad credit?</a></h3></div><div class="answer-content panel-collapse collapse" id="questions-collapse-5"><p>Payday loans are available for people with <a href="../short-term-loans/bad-credit/index.htm">bad credit</a>. Our panel of lenders is deliberately made up of a range of lenders that offer a variety of terms. This allows us to provide credit to the broadest range of customers. Some reasons for a bad credit score are genuine mistakes or one-off situations that have been resolved. We don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s fair to punish you for years by denying you access to the loan market when you might be in need of a little extra money. Depending on your situation, some lenders will charge a higher rate of interest to borrowers with a low credit score, which they see as a direct reflection of the increased risk they are taking. With our service, even those with bad credit know they are getting the best rates available to them at that time.</p><p>If you apply for a quick loan, accept the loan offer, then make all the scheduled payments as agreed, a payday loan should only help to improve your credit rating.</p></div></div><div class="question panel panel-default"><div class="panel-heading"><h3 class="panel-title"><a data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#questions-collapse" href="#questions-collapse-6">Is it best to apply online?</a></h3></div><div class="answer-content panel-collapse collapse" id="questions-collapse-6"><p>Using our online application process will ensure you get access to the best deal in the shortest possible time.

We design everything to ensure the money gets into your account as quickly as possible.</p><p>Just because a quick loan is easy to apply for, it doesn&#8217;t mean you should consider a fix for every financial situation. Payday loans are designed to offer short-term relief from an unexpected expense. They should not be used as a solution to longer-term financial difficulty.</p></div></div><div class="question panel panel-default"><div class="panel-heading"><h3 class="panel-title"><a data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#questions-collapse" href="#questions-collapse-7">Will you charge me a fee when I apply?</a></h3></div><div class="answer-content panel-collapse collapse" id="questions-collapse-7"><p>Our service is free to use for all applicants.

The amount of time you take to repay the loan is also up to you, although most people like to clear smaller loans quicker to minimise the interest they are charged. You can select a repayment period from 3 to 36-months. It&#8217;s important to be realistic about how much you can comfortably afford to pay each month when selecting your repayment period, as you don&#8217;t want the loan repayment to put you into further financial difficulty.</p><p>If you do struggle to make an agreed payment on time, it&#8217;s essential to communicate with your lender.

The funds would then be deducted from their next pay packet. The main similarity between subs from an employer and a payday loan is they are both usually for small amounts, and they are typically required to tide us over temporarily.</p><p>The wide range of amounts and repayment terms have developed a category of loan in its own right. This allows people who need to borrow a larger amount to keep the payments to a reasonable level, rather than having a massive deduction from their wages and just deferring the financial pain until your next payday. People borrowing a <a href="../small-loans/index.htm">smaller amount</a> will still usually opt for a shorter repayment period. This helps to minimise the interest they are charged.</p></div></div><div class="question panel panel-default"><div class="panel-heading"><h3 class="panel-title"><a data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#questions-collapse" href="#questions-collapse-10">Is it okay if I repay my quick loan early?</a></h3></div><div class="answer-content panel-collapse collapse" id="questions-collapse-10"><p>Lenders will allow you to settle a loan before it&#8217;s due. However, if you think you&#8217;ll be doing this, it can be a good idea to look at the terms of the loan before you accept the offer. Many lenders will reduce the amount of interest charged to reflect the shorter loan period. However, others may stipulate you have to pay the full amount of interest regardless of whether you settle the loan earlier than required.</p><p>All reputable direct lenders are regulated by the FCA (Financial Conduct Authority). This means they must be transparent about the terms of any loan they offer you. If you can&#8217;t find the information you want, ask the question.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="loan-guides-section loan-guides-small"><div class="more-guides-section"><div
